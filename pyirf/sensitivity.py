    """
    Calculate the relative sensitivity defined as the flux
    relative to the reference source that is detectable with
    significance ``target_significance``.

    Given measured ``n_on`` and ``n_off``,
    we estimate the number of gamma events ``n_signal`` as ``n_on - alpha * n_off``.

    The number of background events ``n_background` is estimated as ``n_off * alpha``.

    In the end, we find the relative sensitivity as the scaling factor for ``n_signal``
    that yields a significance of ``target_significance``.

    The reference time should be incorporated by appropriately weighting the events
    before calculating ``n_on`` and ``n_off``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_on: int or array-like
        Number of signal-like events for the on observations
    n_off: int or array-like
        Number of signal-like events for the off observations
    alpha: float
        Scaling factor between on and off observations.
        1 / number of off regions for wobble observations.
    significance: float

    significance_function: function
        A function f(n_on, n_off, alpha) -> significance in sigma
        Used to calculate the significance, default is the Li&Ma
        likelihood ratio test formula.

    """
    Calculate sensitivity for DL2 event lists in bins of reconstructed energy.

    Sensitivity is defined as the minimum flux detectable with ``target_significance``
    sigma significance in a certain time.

    This time must be incorporated into the event weights.

    Two conditions are required for the sensitivity:
    - At least ten weighted signal events
    - The weighted signal must be larger than 5 % of the weighted background
    - At least 5 sigma (so relative_sensitivity > 1)

    If the conditions are not met, the sensitivity will be set to nan.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_hist: astropy.table.QTable
        Histogram of detected signal events as a table.
        Required columns: n and n_weighted.
        See ``pyirf.binning.create_histogram_table``
    background_hist: astropy.table.QTable
        Histogram of detected events as a table.
        Required columns: n and n_weighted.
        See ``pyirf.binning.create_histogram_table``
    alpha: float
        Size ratio of signal region to background region
    target_significance: float
        Required significance
    significance_function: callable
        A function with signature (n_on, n_off, alpha) -> significance.
        Default is the Li & Ma likelihood ratio test.

    -------
    sensitivity_table: astropy.table.QTable

        Contains weighted and unweighted number of signal and background events

def estimate_background(
    events, reco_energy_bins, theta_cuts, alpha, background_radius
):
    '''
    Estimate the number of background events for a point-like sensitivity.

    Due to limited statistics, it is often not possible to just apply the same
    theta cut to the background events as to the signal events around an assumed
    source position.

    Here we calculate the expected number of background events for the off
    regions by taking all background events up to `background_radius` away from
    the camera center and then scale these to the size of the off region,
    which is scaled by 1 / alpha from the size of the on region given by the
    theta cuts.

        Desired bin edges in reconstructed energy for the background rate
    theta_cuts: astropy.table.QTable
        The cuts table for the theta cut,
        e.g. as returned by ``~pyirf.cuts.calculate_percentile_cut``.
        Columns `center` and `cut` are required for this function.
    alpha: float
        size of the on region divided by the size of the off region.
    background_radius: astropy.units.Quantity[angle]
        Maximum distance from the fov center for background events to be taken into account
